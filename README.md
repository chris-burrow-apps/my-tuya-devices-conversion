Recently I have been frustrated with my Tuya devices not talking with the Tuya services; so I am not able to turn devices on and off, monitor energy etc. I decided to document my experience with how to convert devices to locally controlled using Home Assistant.

A few people asked me how I discovered how to make Tuya devices offline so I made a quick Tutorial on how I did it.
